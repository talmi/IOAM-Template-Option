Abstract

   In situ measurement is performed by incorporating performance related
   information into in-flight data packets.  This document specifies a
   new IOAM Option-Type that has a fixed length and can be updated by
   transit nodes along the path.  It enables lightweight monitoring
   using constant-length data that does not depend on the number of hops
   in the network.

1.  Introduction

   In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) [RFC9197]
   is used for measuring and monitoring a network by incorporating
   measurement and operational data into some or all of the data
   packets.  [RFC9197] has defined several Option-Types, intended for
   different purposes.

   This document introduces a new IOAM Option-Type that can be
   incorporated into data packets and updated by transit nodes along the
   path.  Compared to existing IOAM Trace Option-Types, the new Option-
   Type provides coarse-grained performance information using data
   fields that have a constant length.

Internet-Draft              Fixed IOAM Option                  July 2025


   There are several in-progress proposals that use a fixed-size
   telemetry header, including [I-D.cxx-ippm-ioamaggr],
   [I-D.mzbc-ippm-transit-measurement-option],
   [I-D.xiao-ippm-ioam-trace-extensions],
   [I-D.filsfils-ippm-path-tracing] and [I-D.ravi-ippm-csig].  These
   proposals can potentially benefit from the IOAM Option-Type that is
   presented in this document.

2.  Conventions

2.1.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Terminology

   Abbreviations used in this document:

   IOAM:      In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

   OAM:       Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

   The terms Option-Type, encapsulating node, decapsulating node, and
   transit node are defined in [RFC9197].

3.  Use Cases

   There is a set of use cases that the current IOAM Option-Types do not
   support.  This section lists a set of use cases for the IOAM Template
   Option-Type.

   *  Aggregated information: aggregated information across several
      nodes, e.g., [I-D.cxx-ippm-ioamaggr].  Many applications
      interested in telemetry data across a path are not focused on
      individual node's telemetry, but on an aggregated metric that can
      provide a more holistic picture.  Aggregating IOAM data along a
      network path meets this requirement.  IOAM nodes do not only
      retrieve information, but also perform functions such as sum,
      average, minimum, or maximum of a given data parameter and carry
      the result to the next IOAM node in an IOAM data field.

Internet-Draft              Fixed IOAM Option                  July 2025


   *  Congestion information: information relating to the congestion
      status can be collected from nodes along the path, e.g.,
      [I-D.ravi-ippm-csig] providing a finer level of granularity than
      conventional ECN while limiting the congestion status to a fixed
      size.

   *  Combined information: a combination of aggregated information and
      congestion-related information can be collected along the path,
      e.g., [I-D.mzbc-ippm-transit-measurement-option], while using a
      fixed size.

4.  Requirements for the IOAM Template Option-Type

   This section lists requirements for the IOAM Template Option-Type:

   *  Templates supported MUST have a fixed length and fixed structure.
      Fixed length and structure are to simplify parsing of the Option-
      Type.

   *  Each templates is a composition of one or more data fields.

   *  Data fields within a template can have different sizes (e.g., 8
      bits, 16 bits, 32 bits).

   *  Templates MUST align to 4 octet boundaries.  If necessary, padding
      fields are used to guarantee 4-octet alignment.

   *  Data fields within a Template can be read-only for IOAM nodes or
      read-write for IOAM nodes, depending on their use.

   *  The IOAM Template Option-Type SHOULD support IETF defined (IANA
      registry) Templates for use-cases which are defined by the IETF as
      well as custom/deployment specific templates, that are defined by
      the operator and are specific to a deployment.

5.  In situ Template Option-Type

   This document defines a new IOAM Option-Type, the Template Option-
   Type.  The length of the Template Option-Type MUST NOT be modified by
   IOAM transit nodes.  However, IOAM transit nodes MAY modify the
   option data in the Template Option-Type.  Figure 1 presents the
   format of this Option-Type.

                       Figure 1: Template Option-Type

   An IOAM node that complies to this draft MUST support the following
   fields, as depicted in Figure 1:

   Namespace-ID:  A 16-bit namespace identifier, as defined in
      [RFC9197].

   Template-ID:  An 8-bit identifier that specifies the template that
      follows.  A new registry is defined for this field, as specified
      in Section 7.  The value 0 has been assigned, indicating "No
      Option Data".  Assignments of values 1 to 127 are controlled by
      IANA.  Values 128 to 255 are can be defined by an operator for a
      specific deployment.

   Length:  An 8-bit length that specifies the size of the Template-Data
      in multiples of 4 octets.

   Template-Data:  The data that follows the Template-ID has a constant
      length.  The semantics and length of the data are determined by
      the Template-ID.  The option data might consist of more than one
      sub-field.

   The specification of the Template-ID values and the corresponding
   option data formats is outside the scope of this document.

   As in [RFC9197], the Template Option-Type can be incorporated into
   all or a subset of the traffic that is forwarded by the encapsulating
   node.  Notably, this option adds a fixed and low overhead to data
   packets, which remains constant along the path.

6.  Examples

   The section lists examples of how the template option can be used.

6.1.  IOAM Data Aggregation Along The Path

   [I-D.cxx-ippm-ioamaggr] describes use cases to aggregate IOAM data
   along a network path.  Rather than just collecting data at IOAM
   nodes, data is collected and processed by the IOAM nodes - using
   functions like sum, average, minimum, or maximum of a given data
   parameter - and the result stored in a data field called "Aggregate"
   (see below).  The Template Option can be used to support this use-
   case with the following example template:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |        Namespace-ID           |  TBD_1        |   Length=2    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |               IOAM Data Param                 |  Aggregator   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           Aggregate                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                       Figure 2: Aggregation Template

   IOAM Data Param:  This field identifies the data parameter that is to
      be aggregated across the nodes.  It MUST be set by the IOAM
      encapsulating node.  IOAM transit nodes MUST NOT change it.

   Aggregator:  This 8-bit field identifies the aggregation function
      that is to be applied.  Its value MUST be set by the IOAM
      encapsulating node.  IOAM transit nodes MUST not change it.  The
      following aggregators are defined: Sum, Min, Max, Average.

   Aggregate:  This 32-bit field contains the aggregated value.  Its
      value is initialized by the encapsulating node,in general by
      simply recording the value of its data parameter that is to be
      aggregated.  The field is updated by each subsequent node pre the
      requested aggregation, including IOAM transit nodes as well as the
      IOAM decapsulating node (prior to performing decapsulation).

6.2.  Transit Measurement Template

   The use case that is presented in
   [I-D.mzbc-ippm-transit-measurement-option] provides aggregated
   transit delay information, as well as congestion status of transit
   nodes, as shown in the following template:

      |   Hop Count   |            Status Bitmap                      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                   Figure 3: Transit Measurement Template

   Accumulated Delay:  represents the sum of the transit delay values in
      nanoseconds along the path of the packet, including the current
      node.

   Hop Count/Status Bitmap:  indicates the devices along the path that
      have experienced congestion.  Hop Count is a one-octet field that
      indicates the number of hops since the encapsulating node, and is
      updated by each transit node.  Status Bitmap is a three octet
      field that represents the congestion status of each transit node
      along the path.  The value '1' indicates that the current packet
      was enqueued in a queue that is congested.

7.  IANA Considerations

   To be added to a future version of this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in
   [RFC9197].  The Template Option-Type may be used for reconnaissance,
   which in turn can facilitate other types of attacks.  As in other
   types of IOAM data fields, a malicious attacker can manipulate the
   field values in order to create a false illusion of nonexistent
   network issues or prevent the detection of actual ones.
